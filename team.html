            <h1>Meet Our Team</h1>
            <h3>MEET CHRIS AND GARY JACOBS</h3>
            <p>Chris and Gary Jacob have been the smiling faces of Dania Eye Center for over 35 years. Gary is our optician and Chris handles the retail sales. They are knowledgeable and friendly and have seen multiple generations of families come through the practice. They enjoy the initimate feel of a small family run practice where they can spend time with people and getting to help them with their optical needs. Unlike the big chain stores, they are one of the few left that repair, adjust, and fit frames to personalize the needs of all their patients.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We take pride in our customer service and if there is a problem, we are happy to address it. They have been a long time supporters of the Dania Beach community, seeing underprivileged children and disadvantaged adults through the Lions Club Eyecare program.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In their down time, Gary enjoys playing golf, working on his 300 gallon reef tank, working out, training, and mentoring young men as they pursue their fitness goals. Chris enjoys reading, cooking, and entertaining. They both adore their loveable Goldendoodles, Jaxson and Zeke and love spending time with their children and grandchildren.</p>
